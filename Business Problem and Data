Introducing the dataset on the accidents and collision statisitics from the database, we aim to predict or determine the severity of the accident based on factors such as as weather, roadcondition, type of collision and generic point of collision.
The business problem is predicting the severity of a collision based on the following below inputs
Neceessary checkpoints need to be introduced when repeated collisions of similar occurence take place.The traffic can be corrdinated to almost predict the possblity of a collision. For example, if we know that it is raining, and hte chances of the collison are high, the respected roadway can be shut down and the route altered, or the pedestrians can be barred from the roadway where chances of collision involving oedestrians are high.
We will consider the following parameters
All cases with matched criteria
ADDRTYPE- Point where the collison has occured
SEVERITY CODE- This will be our ML output - to predict the severity of the collision based on the datasets given/ added furthermore.(0- Unknown, 1-Property damage, 2-Injury)
Collision Type- Does it involve pedestrians, collisions at angles.
Number  of people involved in the collision
Number of pedestrians  involved
Number of Pedalcyclists involved
Number of vehicle count
serious injuries count
Under influence of Alcohol
weather
roadcondition
light condition
Speeding
Hit parked  car or not.
